## What is SimpleCRM?
Simple CRM seeks to provide a simple interaction database for an organization to track interactions with other individuals at hosted events. This CRM can be managed by a one-person shop to a small business and is perfect for anyone looking to quickly start tracking connections at their events. This project was inspired by a friend with the need for a simple CRM to track interactions with people at events they host.

SimpleCRM is a web application that allows for the basic functionalities of a Customer Relationship Management system. The user may create customers, bind those customers to their organization, create events, and log interactions at those events.
